<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
Cyberprobe is a network packet inspection toolkit (Deep Packet Inspection)
for real-time monitoring of networks. This has applications in network
monitoring, intrusion detection, forensic analysis, and as a defensive
platform. Cyberprobe packet inspection works on physical networks, and also
in cloud VPCs. There are features that allow cloud-scale deployments.
</p>

<p>
This is not a single, monolithic intrusion detection toolkit which does
everything you want straight out of the box. If that’s what you need, I
would suggest you look elsewhere. Instead, Cyberprobe is a set of flexible
components which can combined in many ways to manage a wide variety of
packet inspection tasks. If you want to build custom network analytics there
are many interfaces that make this straightforward.
</p>

<div>
The project maintains a number of components, including:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      cyberprobe, which collects data packets and forwards them a network stream
      protocol in real time. Packet collection can be target with IP addresses,
      CIDR ranges or full-take.  Collected packets are tagged with a device
      identifier. cyberprobe can be integrated with Snort to allow dynamic
      targeting of IP addresses in response to a Snort rule hitting.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      cybermon, which receives collected packet streams, performs stateful
      processing and creates a stream of observations describing network
      events. The events can be consumed in many different ways e.g. the events
      can be delivered to a pub/sub system, or presented to a gRPC service. The
      event handling is implemented as a function written in Lua, so you can add
      your own custom event handling.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      a set of subscribers which can be used to do things with the captured data
      e.g. store to ElasticSearch, BigQuery or Gaffer.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Cyberprobe</h3>

<div>The probe, cyberprobe has the following features:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Can be tasked to collect packets from an interface and forward any which
        match a configurable address list. The address list can be individual IP
        addresses, CIDR ranges, or collect-all tasking (‘0.0.0.0/0’).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Can be configured to receive Snort alerts. In this configuration,
        when an alert is received from Snort, the IP source address
        associated with the alert is dynamically targeted for a
        configurable period of time. This is
        useful for e.g. collecting data from any network actor who triggers
        a snort
        rule and is thus identified as a potential attacker.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Can optionally offer a management API which allows remote
        interrogation of the state, and alteration of the
        configuration. This allows dynamic alteration of the targeting
        map, and integration with other systems.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Can be configured to deliver on one of two standard stream protocols.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Can insert a packet collection delay line of configurable duration. This
        can be useful e.g. with snort alert triggering to make sure all packets
        which trigger an alert are collected.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
  
<h3>Cybermon</h3>

<div>
The monitor tool, cybermon has the following features:

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Analyses packets delivered in the ETSI stream protocol from one or more
      cyberprobe instances.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Decodes a number of packet protocols to detect network events, which are
      delivered to your configuration in near-real-time.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Decoded information is made available to user-configurable logic (written
      in Lua) to define how the decoded data is handled. Sample configuration
      files are provided to deliver to RabbitMQ in JSON, a gRPC endpoint, and
      deliver to a redis queue.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Packet forgery techniques are included, which allow resetting TCP
      connections, and forging DNS responses. This can be invoked from your Lua
      configuration.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Supports IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, DNS, SMTP, FTP, TLS and more.  The code
      is targeted at the Linux platform, although it is generic enough to be
      applicable to other UN*X-like platforms.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Subscribers</h3>

<div>
The event stream from cybermon can be presented to RabbitMQ in a JSON form,
which can then be delivered to further analytics:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>cybermon-alert reports indicator hits in events to standard output.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cybermon-bigquery loads events into GCP BigQuery.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cybermon-cassandra loads events into Cassandra.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cybermon-detector studies events for the presence of indicators. Events are annotated with indicator hits of any are observed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cybermon-dump dumps raw event JSON to standard output.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cybermon-elasticsearch loads events into ElasticSearch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cybermon-gaffer loads network information into Gaffer (a graph database).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cybermon-geoip looks up IP addresses in GeoIP and annotates events with location information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cybermon-monitor outputs event information to standard output.</p>
  </li>
</div>

<h3>Scaling</h3>

<div>
The architecture has support for AWS Traffic Mirroring, and supports
cloud-scale deployments:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Multiple cyberprobe instances can load-share across multiple cybermon instances behind a load-balancer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The event stream from cybermon can be delivered to a pub/sub system to distribute load and permit scale-up.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
